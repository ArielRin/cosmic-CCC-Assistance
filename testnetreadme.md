Istanbul EVM to use as try to compile as the pragma is set at 0.7.6

no optimisation and evm istanbul address deployed is = 0xA9EB79248705D90830a1Eb9C6F5047D1855a6186

distributor has to be deployed first then the token as the contract hasnt a function to deploy the distributor on deploy of token

distributor compiled and also verified and published

token trial once again 20 mins

token verify failed

failed needs auth import fix and could do with original source to see why and how they made it this way .

flattened file good to deploy but this still broken with rewards and the deploy of distributor prior to this
