# Cosmic Collab Coin (CCC) Contract Assistance

## Overview

The `Cosmic Collab Coin` (CCC) is a custom token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with advanced functionalities, such as auto-liquidity, reflection-based dividends, transaction fees, and a dividend distribution system for holders. It aims to create a sustainable ecosystem by encouraging holding through reflection rewards and automated liquidity management.

This token is built with `SafeMath` for mathematical operations to prevent overflow errors, and a structured `Auth` contract to control ownership and access, ensuring only authorized addresses can perform certain actions. It also implements various interfaces and libraries to handle dividends and transaction restrictions.

## Key Functionalities

### Basic Token Details

- **Token Name:** Cosmic Collab Coin
- **Token Symbol:** `$CCC`
- **Decimals:** 9
- **Total Supply:** 250,000 CCC tokens

### Features and Functionalities

1. **Fee Structure**  
   Each transaction incurs a fee comprising liquidity, reflection, and buyback components:
   - **Liquidity Fee:** Adds tokens to liquidity to enhance token stability.
   - **Reflection Fee:** Distributes a portion of the fee as dividends to holders.
   - **Buyback Fee:** Uses fees to buy back tokens, supporting the token's price stability.

2. **Automated Liquidity**  
   The contract manages liquidity through its auto-liquidity feature. A portion of the transaction fees are added to the liquidity pool, contributing to price stability and providing a reserve for smoother trading.

3. **Dividend Distribution**  
   CCC rewards token holders with reflections from each transaction based on their token holdings. The `DividendDistributor` contract handles the distribution of dividends (in this case, a reward token) to all eligible token holders.

4. **Blacklist and Cooldown System**  
   The contract can blacklist certain addresses and enable cooldowns to prevent rapid buy-sell actions (or bot activity) and protect holders from pump-and-dump schemes.

5. **Airdrop Functions**  
   This contract supports airdrops to reward users or distribute tokens for promotions. It includes:
   - `multiTransfer`: Allows sending different amounts to multiple addresses.
   - `multiTransfer_fixed`: Allows sending a fixed amount to multiple addresses.

6. **Transaction Limits and Restrictions**  
   - **Max Transaction Limit:** Limits the maximum amount of tokens that can be transacted.
   - **Max Wallet Balance:** Limits the maximum number of tokens a wallet can hold, preventing excessive accumulation.
   - **Cooldown Feature:** A cooldown between transactions is implemented to discourage frequent trading.

7. **Swap and Liquidity Management**  
   The contract has a `swapBack` feature, which automatically swaps a portion of fees collected into BNB and provides liquidity on PancakeSwap.

8. **Administrative Control**  
   Only authorized addresses, such as the owner or approved addresses, can update certain features, including transaction fees, max wallet limits, and blacklist functionality.

### Security and Safety Mechanisms

- **Only Owner and Authorized Control:** Ensures that only the owner or an authorized address can make significant changes, such as enabling trading, adjusting fees, or managing the blacklist.
- **Dividends Calculation with Precision:** The contract uses `SafeMath` for accurate calculations, especially when distributing dividends and handling liquidity.
- **Anti-Bot Protection:** Blacklist and cooldown features provide protection against bots and manipulative trading patterns.
- **Automatic Swap and Liquidity:** The contractâ€™s swap functionality reduces manual intervention, improving security by limiting owner control over funds.
- **Dividend Exemptions:** Certain addresses, like the liquidity pair and contract itself, are exempt from dividends to maintain a healthy dividend distribution.

## Contract Functions Summary

1. **Token Transfer Functions**
   - `transfer` and `transferFrom` facilitate transfers and allow approvals for token spending.

2. **Dividend Management**
   - `setDistributionCriteria` sets the minimum period and distribution required for dividends.
   - `process` distributes dividends automatically, based on available gas and distribution settings.

3. **Fee and Limit Settings**
   - Allows setting and updating of fees, swap thresholds, and transaction limits, enabling the owner to adjust the contract for different trading environments.

4. **Ownership and Authorization**
   - `authorize`, `unauthorize`, and `transferOwnership` allow the owner to manage permissions.

5. **Automated Liquidity Management**
   - `swapBack` handles automatic token swaps for liquidity management.

6. **Airdrop Functions**
   - `multiTransfer` and `multiTransfer_fixed` support distributing tokens to multiple addresses simultaneously.

## Usage Example

This contract is designed for deployment on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), but it could be adapted for other EVM-compatible chains. It is ideal for projects needing a comprehensive token system that manages rewards and fees, handles liquidity, and supports anti-bot protection mechanisms.
